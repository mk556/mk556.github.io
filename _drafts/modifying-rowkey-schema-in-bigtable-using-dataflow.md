Cloud Bigtable is a petabyte-scale, fully managed NoSQL database service in GCP for large analytical and operational workloads. It supports the open source industry standard [HBase API](https://hbase.apache.org/), and has integrations with GraphDBs, TSDBs, Geospatial DBs ( [link](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/integrations) ). Actually, Bigtable was initially released in 2005, but wasn't available to general public until 2015. Apache HBase was created based on Google's publication [Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data](http://research.google.com/archive/bigtable.html) with initial release in 2008.
